    "Each line of the file corresponds to a medical note. Each note has a date that needs to be extracted, but each date is encoded in one of many formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "1- Have a look to the lines and take note of the different date formats in the file\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Design and check a regular expression for each of these formats. Use vectorized strings in order to avoid loops\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Try to rewrite these expressions more compactly (for example, by merging two or three regular expressions in one)\n",
    "\n",
    "4- Create a dataframe with four columns: the original text, the month, the day and the year. All three fields must be numeric and the year must be represented by 4 digits. All texts must have this data extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "5- Save the final DataFrame to an excel file with name \"processed_dates.xlsx\"\n",

    "### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assume all dates where year is encoded in only two digits are years from the 1900's (e.g. 1/5/89 is January 5th, 1989)\n",
    "* If the day is missing (e.g. 9/2009), assume it is the first day of the month (e.g. September 1, 2009).\n",
    "* If the month is missing (e.g. 2010), assume it is the first of January of that year (e.g. January 1, 2010).\n",
    "* There could be potential typos as this is a raw, real-life derived dataset."
